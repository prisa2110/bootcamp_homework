    <p>Mackinac Island's old-world charm (think: horse-drawn carriages and Victorian buildings) will make travelers feel like they've stepped back in time. The island banned cars in 1898, so tourists – or Fudgies as locals call them – can only access the island by ferry or plane. Once on Mackinac, visitors can taste some of its world-famous fudge, tour historical sights like Fort Mackinac and explore its state park, which covers more than 80% of the island. Keep in mind, though, that many of Mackinac Island's attractions are closed during the winter months despite the island being accessible year-round.</p>

    <p>This western Michigan town takes its Dutch heritage seriously. During the holiday season, the downtown area transforms into a tribute to all Dutch holiday traditions, complete with roaming carolers and a European-style, open-air Christmas market called Kerstmarkt. Come spring, visitors can celebrate the town's millions of tulip blooms during the Tulip Time Festival, which hosts fun parades and events like traditional Dutch dancing and live musical performances.</p>
